# Big O Notation Cheatsheet & Code Examples

Understanding time and space complexity is key to writing efficient code.  
This project explores the core principles of Big O Notation through simple explanations and Python examples.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- Clear breakdown of common Big O complexities (O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n^2), etc.)
- Real-world analogies to simplify complex concepts
- Python code snippets to demonstrate performance differences
- Helpful comments and print statements for better comprehension

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Big O is the language of algorithm efficiency.  
Whether you're optimizing code, preparing for interviews, or leveling up as a developer — this foundation is essential.

## 💡 Tech Used

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code / PyCharm
- Markdown for documentation


## 🤓 Author Note

Crafted with clarity in mind — and a little help from AI — this project aims to make Big O less scary and way more logical.
