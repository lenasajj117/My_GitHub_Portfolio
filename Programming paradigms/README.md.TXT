# Programming Paradigms

A tidy overview of key programming paradigms that shape how we write and structure code. This project showcases the implementation and behavior of:

## 1. Procedural Programming
Step-by-step instructions, like a recipe — ideal for linear logic and tight control over flow. Functions and procedures do the heavy lifting.

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Everything’s an object. Data and behavior are bundled together in classes, with principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 3. Event-Driven Programming
Reacting to events like user inputs, sensor signals, or messages. It’s the heartbeat of GUIs and interactive applications.

### Crafted with a paradigm-shifting vibe and 💻✨
