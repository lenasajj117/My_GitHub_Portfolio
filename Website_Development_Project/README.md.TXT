# Website Development Project 🌐✨

A dynamic multi-page web app built with a blend of front-end & back-end tech. Designed to mimic a real-world shopping site — with clean UI, cool interactivity & backend logic vibes.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🏠 **Responsive Pages**: Home, About, Products, Cart, Checkout, Register & Login — all built with HTML5, CSS3 & JS.
- ⚡ **Client-Side Magic**: JavaScript handles validation & dynamic behavior.
- 🎨 **Structured Styling**: CSS keeps everything fresh, aesthetic & responsive.
- 🗂️ **Asset Management**: Organized folders = smooth scaling & updates.
- 🐘 **Backend Integration (WIP)**: PHP used to simulate backend logic. Database setup attempted (MySQL), but yeah… lil hiccup.
- 🧠 **VS Code Workspace**: Built & managed in VS Code like a pro.
